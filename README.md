# ⚡ Advanced Distribution Management System (ADMS) - Mega Simulation

This repository simulates a **real-world ADMS** with intelligent SCADA control, priority-based restoration, and fault-tolerant grid automation at scale.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

### 🧱 Scaled Smart Grid
- 1,000+ Load Nodes across 10 geographic zones
- 30 Substations + 150+ DER-enabled loads
- Priority-based load classification: High, Medium, Low

### 💥 Fault Simulation
- Cascading blackout across multiple zones
- Removal of DERs and substations in critical regions

### 🧠 SCADA Logic
- Smart switching with retry and escalation logic
- Simulated SCADA command logs with timestamps and delays

### 💸 Cost Engine
- Outage cost by load criticality ($/minute)
- SCADA switching cost tracking
- Per-node restoration cost report

### 📊 Visualization
- Priority-based cost breakdown chart
- Logs and metrics for decision support
